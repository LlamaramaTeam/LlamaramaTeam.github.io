# Llama Meat

The [caravan trader](/docs/mobs/caravan-trader) sometimes offers <img src="../images/raw_llama_meat.png"> llama meat
in his trades. This meat is from llamas that had an accident. He wasn't the one who killed them.
He sells the meat, so that he can raise money to protect other llamas from having the same fate.
